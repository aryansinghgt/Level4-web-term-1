# Workbook One - HTML

## Task 1. Getting Started

[Download the zip file html-workbooks.zip]() and extract the `htmlworkbooks` folder as instructed in class.

- This workbook uses the folder `workbook01`
- This folder contains all relevant exercise files
- Save all files created during this workbook to the `workbook1` folder.
-	Delete the zip file once extracted to avoid confusion.

## Task 1.2 HTML editor.

At MMU you will find a variety of editors installed including Notepad++, Sublime Text, Brackets and Microsoft Visual Studio Code. Installations vary from room to room. 

Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code will be installed in all rooms we teach.

The Visual Studio Code editor is open source and free to install on your own Mac or PC. It is also fast becoming an industry favourite. Note that **Visual Studio Code** is a different app to [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

>If you are using your own laptop in class download and install [MicroSoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).


## Task 1.3 Open a file in your HTML editor.

Follow these steps:

1.	Open Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code editor
2.	Select Open Folder
3.	Navigate to the workbook01 folder on your H drive (or laptop)
4.	Select Open
5.	The assets (the files and sub-folder) in that folder are now displayed on the left pane of the application window.
